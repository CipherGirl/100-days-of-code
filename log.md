# 100 Days Of Code for Web Develeopment - Log

### Day 1: 1 Jan, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Section of Basic HTML and HTML5. Completed 50% of this.

**Thoughts** Had little bit of prior knowledge of HTML and CSS. Found it very easy.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
